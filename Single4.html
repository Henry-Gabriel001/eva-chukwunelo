            It was not until after the Middle Ages, however, that natural law became associated with natural rights. In Greco-Roman and medieval times, doctrines of natural law concerned mainly the duties, rather than the rights, of “Man.” Moreover, as evidenced in the writings of Aristotle and St. Thomas Aquinas, these doctrines recognized the legitimacy of slavery and serfdom and, in so doing, excluded perhaps the most important ideas of human rights as they are understood today—freedom (or liberty) and equality.

The conception of human rights as natural rights (as opposed to a classical natural order of obligation) was made possible by certain basic societal changes, which took place gradually beginning with the decline of European feudalism from about the 13th century and continuing through the Renaissance to the Peace of Westphalia (1648). During this period, resistance to religious intolerance and political and economic bondage; the evident failure of rulers to meet their obligations under natural law; and the unprecedented commitment to individual expression and worldly experience that was characteristic of the Renaissance all combined to shift the conception of natural law from duties to rights. The teachings of Aquinas and Hugo Grotius on the European continent, the Magna Carta (1215) and its companion Charter of the Forests (1217), the Petition of Right (1628), and the English Bill of Rights (1689) in England were signs of this change. Each testified to the increasingly popular view that human beings are endowed with certain eternal and inalienable rights that never were renounced when humankind “contracted” to enter the social order from the natural order and never were diminished by the claim of the “divine right of kings.”

          Human rights in Africa
In 1981 the Eighteenth Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity (replaced by the African Union [AU] in 2002) adopted the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Also known as the “Banjul Charter” for having been drafted in Banjul, Gambia, it entered into force on October 21, 1986, and boasts the vast majority of the states of Africa as parties.

Like its American and early European counterparts, the African charter provides for a human rights commission (the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights), which has both promotional and protective functions. There is no restriction on who may file a complaint with it. In contrast to the European and American procedures, however, concerned states are encouraged to reach a friendly settlement without formally involving the investigative or conciliatory mechanisms of the commission. Also, the African charter did not, at the beginning, call for a human rights court. African customs and traditions, it has been said, have long emphasized mediation, conciliation, and consensus rather than the adversarial and adjudicative procedures that are common to Western legal systems.

Nevertheless, owing largely to political changes wrought by the end of the Cold War, an African Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights (ACHPR) was created in January 2004 to render judgments on the compliance by AU states with the African charter. The court did not replace the commission.

A year earlier, however, in 2003, there came into being the African Court of Justice (ACJ), intended to serve as the AU’s principal judicial body and, in this capacity, to rule on disputes over the interpretation of AU treaties. Concern for rising costs in the face of little forward movement on the part of the ACJ, however, led to proposals for the creation of a new court, the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR). Designed to have two chambers—one for general legal matters that would supersede the ACJ, the other for judgments on the interpretation and application of human rights treaties—the ACJHR came into being when, in 2008, a merger protocol was adopted uniting the ACJ and the ACHPR. It was believed that the ACJHR had the potential to be progressively influential in the protection of human rights in Africa. It was also recognized, however, that this prospect—above all the ACJHR’s legitimacy—depended on the independence and moral character of its judges and on the training and effectiveness of its staff.

It is, in any event, fair to say that the African human rights system was still in its infancy at the beginning of the 21st century, given especially the turmoil and violence that beset northern and sub-Saharan Africa during this time. But four distinctive features of the African charter—and thus, the African human rights system—are noteworthy and give reason for hope. First, the charter provides for economic, social, and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights. In this respect it resembles the American convention and differs from the European convention. Second, in contrast to both the European and American conventions, it recognizes the rights of groups in addition to the family, women, and children. The aged and the infirm are accorded special protection also, and the right of peoples to self-determination is elaborated in the right to existence, equality, and nondomination. Third, it uniquely embraces two third-generation, or “solidarity,” rights: the right to economic, social, and cultural development and the right to national and international peace and security. It differs from other treaties also by detailing individual duties as well as individual rights—to the family, society, the state, and the international African community.
